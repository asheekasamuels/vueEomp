            "description": "Born 23rd April 2001, in the lovely city of Cape Town - I am a seasoned worker who has used my experience in the industry to develop a leadership brand that precedes myself. I am trusted by my peers, and senior leadership because of my consistent commitment to go beyond the expectation. My team engagement is admirable, and my greatest strength is my ability to build genuine trust relationships with all my peers. I have backbone and I am vocal about my opinions always in the best way possible. I am not afraid to put in the effort required to deliver, even if it means coming in early or on an off day not because I am unable to manage my time, but because I always insist on higher standards and knows what it takes to achieve those standards. I am also emotionally balanced and always approaches situations with an open mind. I always strive to operate in the best interest of the business while still managing to factor the human elements that contribute to every scenario."
